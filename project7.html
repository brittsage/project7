	<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
	
	<p class= "place-description"> As a person who loves travelling, I'd say I'd want to go everywhere,but two places that have been on my mind of where I'd like to see 
	would be Italy. I want to go to Italy because it seems like a really nice place to wonder and explore in. </p>

	<h2> <br>A Person I Admire</br> <br>(past or present)</br></h2>
	
	<p class= "person-description">A person I fondly admire would be <span class=important-point"text-decoration:underline">Amy Winehouse</span>. 
	She passed away too soon but continues to live in the hearts of her fans,friends,and 
	family. I admire her because she always did everything her way, didn't let anyone try to change her,and didn't care what anyone thought of 
	her. Her songs are ones I admire very much too.</p>
